# golang-arm [![Docker Pulls](https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/mashape/kong.svg)](https://hub.docker.com/r/mcuadros/golang-arm/)

Golang docker images for ARM based systems, using the official [Dockerfiles](https://github.com/docker-library/golang)

This repository is mainly build for fulfill my requirements, for other projects.
this means that I am not going to update this regularly with new versions, or
distributions. In the other hand PRs are welcome to complete any missing version
or distribution, from the original golang docker images.

Feel free to use the images that are already [published](https://hub.docker.com/r/mcuadros/golang-arm/),
since are backing other stables projects.

### Build environment

This images are being build using a [Raspberry Pi 3 Model B](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b/).
